## 0x00 Introduction to Cybersecurity

Welcome to the course In this introduction to Cybersecurity. This course introduces the reader to concepts, laws, hands of activities and foundational knowledge as applied to cybersecurity. Often the terms cybersecurity and information assurance are used collective. That said they are very different. Cybersecurity is simply the securing of information as moves through a network and across the internet. one main concepts existing as part of cybersecurity is information assurance. Information assurance is based on a security principle referred to as a the CIA. The acronym CIA stands for confidentiality, integrity and assurance. Confidentiality is the process of securing data so that information is kept private between the intended users. Integrity of the data is the assurance that that the data has not been modified and availability is the assurance that information is accessible as needed.

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks. Also known as information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications, whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization. Encryption dates back to the days of Caesar. Caesar used a a vey simple cipher refereed to as the Caesar cipher and was implemented by replacing each of the characters in the note with a letter 3 characters from the original. For instance the character 'A' was replaced by 'X' 'B" became 'Y' and so forth. To decrypt the message reverse the process. There are many forms of codes and ciphers. Reading exercise: See Best Codes https://www.instructables.com/Best-Codes/ Lab: Something from National Cyber League. As technology progressed the need to pass messages secretly in a manner than would be difficult to decode was a challenge. Spies used the one time pad which assured made each encrypted note passed a unique st of encrypted information. During the war, the German used the enigma machine to relay coded messages. With the development of the personal computer came this thing we refere to as the interent and with it a new st of problems emerged. the importance of information assurance.
