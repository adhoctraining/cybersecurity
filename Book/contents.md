What is Cybersecurity
Cybersecuerity is the techniques, process, designs and archectures used in securring devices, networks and data from unauthrized access.

Types of Security
  Information Security
  Operation Security
  Network Security
    Threat model
	- Intercept packets
	- craft packets
	- inject packets
	Firewalls
	- packet filtering
	- stateful
	- proxy
  Business Continuity
  Application Security
  Cloud Security
  Internet of Things Security
  Mobile Security	

Information Assurance
  CIA Triad
    Confidentiality - access of data by an authorizaed user
    Integrity - assuures that information has not been tampered with.
    Availability - insures that data is always availability
    Authorization
    Authentication
    Accounting

### Lab: Lab: How to Hack a Website with Basic HTML Coding: (https://www.wikihow.com/Hack-a-Website-with-Basic-HTML-Coding)
Written by Nicole Levine, MFA

Last Updated: August 13, 2022 Tested

This wikiHow teaches you different ways to gain access to a website by hacking a login page. Websites are far more advanced and secure than they used to be, so there's virtually no way to gain access to private information just by looking at or writing basic HTML. It's much harder to hack into websites in general, especially if you're a novice! But, if you come across an older website written in rudimentary HTML by a beginning web developer, there's a slight chance you may come across passwords in the website's source code. A slightly more reliable way to exploit a website's login screen is to try a SQL injection. Whatever you do, don't hack into any websites without consentâ€”it's illegal and could get you into big trouble.

### Lab: Simulate conditions for the Uber Breach
Case Study:
How a Teenager Hacked Uber: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS4qFPkl_rw)

Find out more about the breach

Purpose: Illustrate how confinetially,Integrity and Availability can be threatened through the attack 
on an employee and the enterprise has poor security protections.

What you will learn:
linux commands: mkdir, cd, touch, nano, cat, top, uname
nmap
wireshark
hydra
crunch
john the ripper

Scenario:
While riding in an Uber you notice a card partially hanging from the visor of the visor on the 
passenger side of the car. Information about the employee login was partially available.

https://company.com/login
Employee: Smith.?
Employee #:emp52__34
password: Roll__t
Social Engineering: 

You find out that the driver attending the University of Alabama
Played football his freshment year as a defense guard wearing the number 62,
Had to srop after injuries from a call accident his freshmen year. His 
inability to play resulted in a loss of his scholarship and withdrawal from the University.

Putting it together you determine:
Employee: Smith.Robert
Employee #:wmp52__34
passord: Roll62tide

A list of all possible numbers using cewl was generated.
Pretending to be the corporate help desk

You are now in.
Has you poke around around you see a few company files.
One of the directories says test_scripts. In one is a hardcoded user and password that will 
give you remote access via ssh. Discovery scan indicates the existence of an internal server. 

Continued in lab 2

Reading: OPM data breach

What you will earn:
Always enumerate
nmap discovery and host scans
jump servers
types of attackers

The nmap discovey scan found a sshd server. Smith.Pobert's credentials do not work.
