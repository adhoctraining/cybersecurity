## 0x04 Offensive view of cybersecurity ##

There is a term called vulnerability assessment which is quite similar to penetration testing.

What is vulnerability, risk, threat

What is the diference between white hat, black hat, and grey hat.

**Types of threat actors**

Cyber terrorists

Government-sponsored/state-sponsored actors

Organized crime/cybercriminals 

Hacktivists

Insiders

**Common Threat Actor Motivations**

Political, Economic, Technical, and Military Agendas: Threat actors such as Hacktivists and Government-Backed Actors share such motivations. They are focused and have a set objective/target in mind when they start planning an attack. Moreover, this data is rarely seen available for sale on the black market.  For example, the absence of data stolen from the Equifax Attack has many wondering whether the attack was orchestrated/sponsored by another country.

Profits/Financial Gain: The profit motivation is one of the most frequent motivations of cybercriminals. These threat actors won't usually care about penetrating a specific organization or  
business.Moreover, they won't care about the discoverability of the crime because they're only interested in stealing assets that they can convert into money as soon as possible.

Notoriety: Some threat actors are motivated by reputation and attention and will actively seek targets that will help them gain recognition. In fact, those agents that seek notoriety will often ignore chances to attack non-visible assets/targets that won't draw any attention.

Revenge: Getting back at someone is a pervasive human trait; it's also a common threat actor motivation. The threat actors who plan an attack for revenge are most likely to be either employees or ex-employees -- giving them intimate knowledge about an organization's systems, networks, and even defenses.

Overlap of Motivations: Of course, a threat actor may be motivated by more than one threat actor motivation. For example, they can have a revenge mindset along with a political agenda.

Understanding threat actors and their motivations is an essential step in the cybersecurity process. It will help you map out your defenses and may help you better outmaneuver attackers successfully. 

Make sure that your organization's threat model accounts for various threat actor motivations. You can do this by assessing what business category you fall into and what kind of threat actors are most likely  
to target you. Use this information as a guide to fixing vulnerabilities, uncovering new ones, and implementing internal security policies. You can get the latest info about emerging attacks here.

Now we should say that some threat actors aren't discovered by anyone for even years at a time, simply because they don't draw attention to themselves. These threats are called Advanced Persistent Threats  
(APTs). 

Threat Intelligence Feeds that grant you access to information about newly-discovered Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are particularly useful when it comes to protecting yourself against such persistent  
threats.
