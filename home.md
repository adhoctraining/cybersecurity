### [Lesson One Introduction to Cybersecurity]()
﻿Chapter 1
Introduction
Welcome to the course In this introduction to Cybersecurity

	This course introduces the reader to concepts, laws, hands of activities and foundational knowledge as applied to cybersecurity. Often the terms cybersecurity and information assurance are used collective. That said they are very different. Cybersecurity is simply the securing of information as moves through a network and across the internet. one main concepts existing as part of cybersecurity is information assurance.  Information assurance is based on a security principle referred to as a the CIA. The acronym CIA stands for confidentiality, integrity and assurance. Confidentiality is the process of securing data so that information is kept private between the intended users. Integrity of the data is the assurance that that the data has not been modified and availability is the assurance that information is accessible as needed.

	Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks. Also known as information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications, whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization. Encryption dates back to the days of Caesar. Caesar used a a vey simple cipher refereed to as the Caesar cipher and was implemented by replacing each of the characters in the note with a letter 3 characters from the original. For instance the character 'A' was replaced by 'X' 'B" became 'Y' and so forth. To decrypt the message reverse the process. There are many forms of codes and ciphers.

As technology progressed the need to pass messages secretly in a manner than would be difficult to decode was a challenge. Spies used the one time pad which assured made each encrypted note passed a unique st of encrypted information. During the war, the German used the enigma machine to relay coded messages.																					
NOTE TO SELF.
When building the book ragged edges should be toward the spine. 
To understand information confidentiality, encryption, codes and ciphers will be covered

What is information security? Definition, principles, and policies

Information security definition

Information security is a set of practices designed to keep personal data secure from unauthorized access and alteration during storing or transmitting from one place to another.

Information security is designed and implemented to protect the print, electronic and other private, sensitive and personal data from unauthorized persons. It is used to protect data from being misused,  
disclosure, destruction, modification, and disruption.

Information security vs. cybersecurity

Information security and cybersecurity may be used substitutable but are two different things. Cybersecurity is a practice used to provide security from online attacks, while information security is a  
specific discipline that falls under cybersecurity. Information security is focusing on network and App code.

Information security principle

There are some basic components of information security which are discussed below.

    Confidentiality is one of the basic elements of information security. Data is confidential when only authorized people access it. To ensure confidentiality one needs to use all the techniques designed  
for security like strong password, encryption, authentication and defense against penetration attacks.

    Integrity refers to maintaining data and preventing it from modifications either accidentally or maliciously. Techniques used for confidentiality may protect data integrity as a cybercriminal can’t  
change data when they can’t get access to it. To ensure integrity in-depth few tools help in improving it.

    Availability is another basic element in information security. It is vital to make sure that your data is not accessed by unauthorized persons but only those who have permission can access it.  
Availability in information security means matching network and computing resources to compute data access and implement a better policy for disaster recovery purposes.

Information security policy

Information security policy is a document that an enterprise draws up, based on its specific needs and quirks. It helps to establish what data to protect and in what ways. These policies guide an  
organization during the decision making about procuring cybersecurity tools. It also mandates employee behavior and responsibilities.

An organization information security policy should include

    It should describe the purpose of the infosec program and objectives
    It must define thekey terms used in the document to ensure shared understanding
    It must contain password policy
    It should determine who has access to what data
    It must include the employee’s roles and responsibilities to safeguard data. [1]
