## 0x00 Introduction to Cybersecurity

Welcome to the course In this introduction to Cybersecurity.
This course introduces the reader to concepts, laws, hands of activities and foundational knowledge as applied to cybersecurity. Often the terms cybersecurity and information assurance are used collective. That said they are very different. Cybersecurity is simply the securing of information as moves through a network and across the internet. one main concepts existing as part of cybersecurity is information assurance.  Information assurance is based on a security principle referred to as a the CIA. The acronym CIA stands for confidentiality, integrity and assurance. Confidentiality is the process of securing data so that information is kept private between the intended users. Integrity of the data is the assurance that that the data has not been modified and availability is the assurance that information is accessible as needed.

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks. Also known as information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications, whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization. Encryption dates back to the days of Caesar. Caesar used a a vey simple cipher refereed to as the Caesar cipher and was implemented by replacing each of the characters in the note with a letter 3 characters from the original. For instance the character 'A' was replaced by 'X' 'B" became 'Y' and so forth. To decrypt the message reverse the process. There are many forms of codes and ciphers.

As technology progressed the need to pass messages secretly in a manner than would be difficult to decode was a challenge. Spies used the one time pad which assured made each encrypted note passed a unique st of encrypted information. During the war, the German used the enigma machine to relay coded messages.	
With the development of the personal computer came this thing we refere to as the interent and with it a new st of problems emerged.
the importance of information assurance.
## 0x01 Introduction to Information Assurance

Information security is a set of practices designed to keep personal data secure from unauthorized access and alteration during storing or transmitting from one place to another. Information security is designed and implemented to protect the print, electronic and other private, sensitive and personal data from unauthorized persons. It is used to protect data from being misused,  
disclosure, destruction, modification, and disruption.

**Information security vs. cybersecurity**

Information security and cybersecurity may be used substitutable but are two different things. Cybersecurity is a practice used to provide security from online attacks, while information security is a specific discipline that falls under cybersecurity. Information security is focusing on network and App code.

**Information security principle**

There are some basic components of information security which are discussed below.

Confidentiality is one of the basic elements of information security. Data is confidential when only authorized people access it. To ensure confidentiality one needs to use all the techniques designed for security like strong password, encryption, authentication and defense against penetration attacks.

Integrity refers to maintaining data and preventing it from modifications either accidentally or maliciously. Techniques used for confidentiality may protect data integrity as a cybercriminal can’t change data when they can’t get access to it. To ensure integrity in-depth few tools help in improving it.

Availability is another basic element in information security. It is vital to make sure that your data is not accessed by unauthorized persons but only those who have permission can access it. Availability in information security means matching network and computing resources to compute data access and implement a better policy for disaster recovery purposes.

**Information security policy**

Information security policy is a document that an enterprise draws up, based on its specific needs and quirks. It helps to establish what data to protect and in what ways. These policies guide an organization during the decision making about procuring cybersecurity tools. It also mandates employee behavior and responsibilities.

An organization information security policy should include

    It should describe the purpose of the infosec program and objectives
    It must define thekey terms used in the document to ensure shared understanding
    It must contain password policy
    It should determine who has access to what data
    It must include the employee’s roles and responsibilities to safeguard data. [1]

Major us federal cybersecurity laws 

**Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) (1996)**

HIPPA was enacted in 1996 and signed by president bill clinton. Before HIPPA, there was no standard method for safeguarding the Protected Personal Information (PPI) that organizations in the healthcare industry stored. there were no security best practices in place.  one of 
the reasons that there were no standards related to cybersecurity in the healthcare industry was that health records were traditionally stored as paper records. Just before the introduction of HIPPA, the healthcare industry was scrambling to move away from paper records to become more efficient.  the need to become more efficient drove the need to access and transfer patient information quickly.

**Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act GLBA) (1999)**

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley was signed into law in 1999.  this law is also known as the financial services modernization act of 1999.
the main thing that glba did was to repeal a portion of an outdated law from 1933.  This 1933 law was called the glass–steagall act.  the glass–steagall act prevented companies from doing combined business in banking, securities, and insurance.  a bank was also not allowed to sell insurance or securities.

**Homeland Security Act (2002)**

The homeland security act was signed into law by george w. bush in 2002. this act included the federal information security management act (fisma).
The united states introduced the homeland security act following several terrorist attacks in the united states.  these terrorist acts include the world trade center bombing and mailing of anthrax spores to some news outlets and some government officials. [2]

## 0x04 Offensive view of cybersecurity ##

There is a term called vulnerability assessment which is quite similar to penetration testing.

**Types of threat actors**

Cyber terrorists

Government-sponsored/state-sponsored actors

Organized crime/cybercriminals 

Hacktivists

Insiders

Script kiddies

Internal user errors

**Common Threat Actor Motivations**

Political, Economic, Technical, and Military Agendas: Threat actors such as Hacktivists and Government-Backed Actors share such motivations. They are focused and have a set objective/target in mind when they start planning an attack. Moreover, this data is rarely seen available for sale on the black market.  For example, the absence of data stolen from the Equifax Attack has many wondering whether the attack was orchestrated/sponsored by another country.

Profits/Financial Gain: The profit motivation is one of the most frequent motivations of cybercriminals. These threat actors won't usually care about penetrating a specific organization or  
business.Moreover, they won't care about the discoverability of the crime because they're only interested in stealing assets that they can convert into money as soon as possible.

Notoriety: Some threat actors are motivated by reputation and attention and will actively seek targets that will help them gain recognition. In fact, those agents that seek notoriety will often ignore chances to attack non-visible assets/targets that won't draw any attention.

Revenge: Getting back at someone is a pervasive human trait; it's also a common threat actor motivation. The threat actors who plan an attack for revenge are most likely to be either employees or ex-employees -- giving them intimate knowledge about an organization's systems, networks, and even defenses.

Overlap of Motivations: Of course, a threat actor may be motivated by more than one threat actor motivation. For example, they can have a revenge mindset along with a political agenda.

Understanding threat actors and their motivations is an essential step in the cybersecurity process. It will help you map out your defenses and may help you better outmaneuver attackers successfully. 

Make sure that your organization's threat model accounts for various threat actor motivations. You can do this by assessing what business category you fall into and what kind of threat actors are most likely  
to target you. Use this information as a guide to fixing vulnerabilities, uncovering new ones, and implementing internal security policies. You can get the latest info about emerging attacks here.

Now we should say that some threat actors aren't discovered by anyone for even years at a time, simply because they don't draw attention to themselves. These threats are called Advanced Persistent Threats  
(APTs). 

Threat Intelligence Feeds that grant you access to information about newly-discovered Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are particularly useful when it comes to protecting yourself against such persistent  
threats. 

## 0x05 Methods of attack ##

**Reconnaissance/Footprinting**
In general, reconnaissance relies upon a composite set of techniques and processes and has not to be considered limited to information characterizing the target at a technological level, such as, the used  
hardware or the version of software components. Attackers also aim at collecting details related to the physical location of the victim, phone numbers, names of the people working in the targeted  
organizations and their email addresses. In fact, any bit of knowledge may be used to develop a software exploit or to reveal weaknesses in the defensive systems.

Information Gathering and getting to know the target systems is the first process in ethical hacking. Reconnaissance is a set of processes and techniques (Footprinting, Scanning & Enumeration) used to  
covertly discover and collect information about a target system.

**Reconnaissance**
This is the first step of Hacking. It is also called as Footprinting and information gathering Phase. This is the preparatory phase where we collect as much information as possible about the target. We usually collect information about three groups,

Network

Host

People involved

There are two types of Footprinting:
Active: Directly interacting with the target to gather information about the target. Eg Using Nmap tool to scan the target
Passive: Trying to collect the information about the target without directly accessing the target. This involves collecting information from social media, public websites etc.


**Scanning**
Three types of scanning are involved:
Port scanning: This phase involves scanning the target for the information like open ports, Live systems, various services running on the host.
Vulnerability Scanning: Checking the target for weaknesses or vulnerabilities which can be exploited. Usually done with help of automated tools
Network Mapping: Finding the topology of network, routers, firewalls servers if any, and host information and drawing a network diagram with the available information. This map may serve as a valuable piece of information throughout the haking process.

**Gaining Access** 
This phase is where an attacker breaks into the system/network using various tools or methods. After entering into a system, he has to increase his privilege to administrator level so he can install an application he needs or modify data or hide data.

**Maintaining Access**
Hacker may just hack the system to show it was vulnerable or he can be so mischievous that he wants to maintain or persist the connection in the background without the knowledge of the user. This can be done using Trojans, Rootkits or other malicious files. The aim is to maintain the access to the target until he finishes the tasks he planned to accomplish in that target.

**Clearing Tracks** 
No thief wants to get caught. An intelligent hacker always clears all evidence so that in the later point of time, no one will find any traces leading to him. This involves modifying/corrupting/deleting the values of Logs, modifying registry values and uninstalling all applications he used and deleting all folders he created.
