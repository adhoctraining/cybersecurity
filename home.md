# Introduction to Cybersecurity

Welcome to the course!

This course introduces the reader to concepts, laws, hands of activities and foundational knowledge as applied to cybersecurity. Often the terms cybersecurity and information assurance are used collective. That said they are very different. Cybersecurity is simply the securing of information as moves through a network and across the internet. one main concepts existing as part of cybersecurity is information assurance. Information assurance is based on a security principle referred to as a the CIA. The acronym CIA stands for confidentiality, integrity and assurance. Confidentiality is the process of securing data so that information is kept private between the intended users. Integrity of the data is the assurance that that the data has not been modified and availability is the assurance that information is accessible as needed.

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks. Also known as information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications, whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization. Encryption dates back to the days of Caesar. Caesar used a a vey simple cipher refereed to as the Caesar cipher and was implemented by replacing each of the characters in the note with a letter 3 characters from the original. For instance the character 'A' was replaced by 'X' 'B" became 'Y' and so forth. To decrypt the message reverse the process. There are many forms of codes and ciphers. Reading exercise: See Best Codes https://www.instructables.com/Best-Codes/ Lab: Something from National Cyber League. As technology progressed the need to pass messages secretly in a manner than would be difficult to decode was a challenge. Spies used the one time pad which assured made each encrypted note passed a unique st of encrypted information. During the war, the German used the enigma machine to relay coded messages. With the development of the personal computer came this thing we refere to as the interent and with it a new st of problems emerged. the importance of information assurance.

**What is Cybersecurity?**

Cybersecurity is the process or practice of ensuring and maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data and information. It involves the protection of computers and computer systems, networks, mobile devices, data, and applications (programs) from cyberattacks. As alluded to earlier, these attacks are aimed at interrupting normal business proceedings, obtaining or destroying information, and extortion or ransom.

Cybersecurity effectively involves numerous layers to cover the many entry points that may be chosen. Physical devices, connected networks, and data, for instance, should all be covered.

 

The components of Cybersecurity are:

**Processes**

This is how you or any organization responds to attacks, whether just attempted or successful. It helps guide on how to identify them, protect yourself against them, recover from them, and prevent them altogether. For organization, this is captured in the ICT Policies and Business Continuity Plan/Process (BCPs).

**Technology**

Technology is the sword/ shield you wield against cyberattacks. It is part of the processes. These are the various tools you will make use of in mitigating attacks. This can be at the device level, at the network level, or for cloud infrastructure. Antivirus software, firewalls, Intrusion Detection, and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS & IDS), and DNS Filters all are examples of technology.

**Users**

The first two components heavily rely on this one. Users, even with the best-formulated processes and bleeding-edge technology, can easily self-sabotage and make all that moot. The basics are essential: strong and unique passwords, not exposing those passwords, checking email addresses, watching out for fishy attachments, and regular backups. Having a 26-character password is useless if it is written down on a real or virtual sticky note on your real or virtual desktop.

**Types of Cybersecurity**

Protection against the different types of cybersecurity attacks requires that you know the different types of cybersecurity. The different types often work in tandem to give end-to-end security.

* Application Security: The use of both software and hardware to ensure that applications are protected from external threats, even when in development. Applications require constant updates to stay up to date with any potential threats. Bugs and loopholes can be exploited to devastating effect.

* Information Security: InfoSec refers to protecting your data or the data belonging to clients whether stored or in transit. It involves protecting data in any form, digital or otherwise, from (unrestricted) access, manipulation, destruction, or disclosure/ distribution. In short, data availability, privacy, and confidentiality.

* Operational Security: These are the processes involved when dealing with data security. Handling, access permissions, networking, data transmission, and data storage.

* Network Security: This all the processes involved in ensuring that the network is protected from unauthorized access and external intrusions. A secure networking infrastructure ensures that the internal network (intranet) remains uncompromised.

* Endpoint Security: While remote access is a necessary component of workflows and business models nowadays, endpoint security ensures that it does not become a liability. Endpoint devices are ‘easier’ targets especially if the users are not sensitized to the risks and necessary cautionary steps.

* Identity Management: Issuing rights and system access needs to be a well-document and closely-monitored process. At all times, all user access levels should be monitored and logged, with 2-step security measures employed to prevent impersonator access.

* Disaster Recovery/ BCP: Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) are policies that stipulate the course of action in the event of an attack and/ or loss of data. This includes setting up off-premise sites for regular backups and to reduce the impact of attacks on business continuity.

* End-user Education: The strength of a robust cybersecurity system is only as strong as the weakest entry point. Users must be educated on cybersecurity best practices like regular password change, two-factor authentication, and using VPNs when connecting remotely.
    Infrastructure Security: This covers the physical aspects of computer infrastructure like a well-regulated power delivery system, good physical security, fire extinguishers, and the like.

* Cloud Security: Cloud services are being incorporated into more business models and as such, need to be well configured to prevent any successful attacks.

**The Need for Cybersecurity**

There is a need to curb the different types of attacks in cybersecurity. Most individuals have access to more than one electronic, the default being a smartphone. Devices outnumber people and offer up millions, if not billions, of targets for attackers.

Individually, the threat may not seem as huge when compared to the reports of large corporations being hit. The fact is that you are just as prone, and it may lead to blackmail, identity theft, the loss of years of memories in digital memorabilia, and the financial implications when your devices are rendered useless.

Attacks on large organizations are more publicized, but even small companies get hit. Data breaches in large corporations expose millions of personal records, which could lead to more attacks. Attacks on hospitals may lead to fatalities as more equipment gets connected to the internet. It is the same case for power plants, who’s outage has rippling effects across multiple industries, including the aforementioned hospitals. Society is highly dependent on continuously functional infrastructure.

A recent Data Breach QuickView report states that between January and September of 2019, a reported 5,183 data breaches exposed 7.9 billion records, with a projected mark of 8.5 billion seen as highly probable. Of the over 5,000 breaches, only six accounted for 3.1 billion of those records between the start of Jul and the end of September.

Findings from the report were that medical services, public bodies, and retailers were the hardest hit. It was also noted that hacking was the most frequent form of attack.

In another report, the First Official Annual Cybercrime Report by Cybersecurity ventures, it was predicted that the global cost brought on by cybercrime will grow from $3 trillion in 2015 to $6 trillion by 2021. By cybercrime, it meant data loss, money loss, productivity loss, loss of intellectual property, fraud, embezzlement, investigation costs, data restoration costs, and loss of reputation with clients. It also predicted that global spending on cybersecurity products and services would surpass a trillion dollars cumulatively from 2017 to 2021.

With the need thoroughly articulated, the (summarized) benefits of embracing cybersecurity are:

* End-user protection: It is paramount to not disappoint all the users who have trusted you with their data in the name of acquiring your services.

* Improved client confidence: There is an air of assurance for corporates and organizations that put hold data security in high regard.

* Business protection: Ensured business continuity at all times without any losses in time or resources.

* Improved recovery times: A properly laid-out recovery plan ensures that in the event of a cyberattack, the business will recover as fast and as efficiently as possible.
 
* Data and network security: Data and internal networks should always remain out of reach to intruders, external or internal, and embracing cybersecurity is one step closer to that.

**Types of Cybersecurity Threats**

The world is currently data-driven, and all cyber-attacks can be placed into the following categories:

**Attack on Data Availability**

Remember being virtually held hostage? Attacks in data availability aim to ensure that you are not able to access your data, or that the end-user is unable to. This may be purely malicious and just an attempt to completely disrupt business or more probably to ask for a fee to relinquish access. A lot of organizations have ended up paying attackers so that they can regain access to their data.

**Attack on Data Integrity**

Integrity can either be of an organization or the data itself. If a rogue student hacks into the school’s database and changes all the grades, the data integrity has been compromised. If an attacker gains access to an organization’s database and leaks all the records online, the integrity of that organization has been severely compromised—especially in the eyes of the people whose data it held.

**Attack on Data Confidentiality**

Personal information should be private. If anyone, internal or external gains unauthorized access to your information, then its confidentiality has been compromised. This happens a lot on an individual level, even in our homes and places of work.

The attack types that perpetrate these three attacks on data are:

* Phishing: You have probably been the target of several phishing attempts. Hopefully, they were all unsuccessful. Phishing is sending out fake emails that resemble emails from a genuine source. Your bank will email, asking for your credit card info. Your boss will email, asking for certain credentials or with a fishy attachment. They come in many forms, The trick is to make the email appear as close to genuine as possible, except maybe for one letter in the email address. It is very easy to fall prey to phishing, and it is the most common type of attack.
 
* Malware: This is software created to grant unauthorized access to a device/ system or cause predetermined harm to a device. Viruses fall into this group. Malware can be bundled with downloads, cracked software, clicked ads, browser extensions, and, email attachments. Antivirus software may detect and clean malware, but the delivery channels are getting more cunning and may be bypassed.

* Social Engineering: This is the least technical attack but also arguably the most sophisticated. Social engineering attacks aim to obtain sensitive information from you without you realizing it. You will tell strangers the name of your favorite pet, your mother’s maiden name, and your favorite teacher back in high school. Combined with the other attacks in this list, an attacker can wreak havoc in your life.

* Ransomware: Ransomware is software that blocks your access to your data or encrypts it such that it is unusable without a decryption key. The aim of this attack is mainly financial compensation, mainly in the form of bitcoin to avoid tracing. There is no guarantee that paying the attacker will get you your data back, but you are probably desperate at that point.

* Advanced Persistent Threats: An attacker may gain access to a system/ network and remain there undetected and under the radar. This can end in very many different ways.

**Mitigation of Cybersecurity Attacks**

At this point, the world has embraced technology and the novel challenges that come with it. Knowing the different types of data breaches helps put in place the necessary protective measures. There is a lot to lose but not much to gain, but the goal is to maintain the status quo as pertains to data privacy and business operations. Taking the following steps goes a long way in maintaining it.

* VA and Pen-tests: Organizations should schedule regular vulnerability assessment and penetration tests to determine how secure the infrastructure truly is. Any discovered loopholes should be documented and patched.

* DR & BCP: All organizations should have disaster recovery and business continuity plans. This should include switch-over dry-runs to ensure that the personnel is ready at any time to efficiently initiate the move of operations from the primary site to the DR site and that the organization is up and running in no time.

* User Education and Training: Employees need to be trained on the importance of vigilance when it comes to cybersecurity. Phishing and social engineering should be vividly illustrated.

* User-rights Management/ IAM: Identity and Access Management helps administrators keep track of who has access to what and under which circumstances. This close control enforces data security and helps easily identify anomalies.

* Cloud Security: With more and more business going the cloud route, it is important to ensure that your cloud provider is capable of keeping your data completely safe and always available.

* IDS and IPS: A combination of Intrusion Prevention and Intrusion Detection systems keep intruders at bay while making their intentions known early enough.

* Regular Backups: Regular backups prevent against data loss, giving you a fall back should anything happen to your primary device.

* Secure Web Practices: Safe web browsing involves only using secure sites, not clicking on ads and pop-ups, watching what you download, and not answering emails that promise you wealth.

* Device Updates and Security Patches: Devices updates and security are important in mitigating cybersecurity attacks. They ensure all discovered loopholes are covered.

* Incident Management: Any cybersecurity incident should be well documented and communicated. This provides a log that proves effective when finding ways to improve on existing cybersecurity controls
    
* Removable Media Controls: Staff may willingly or unwillingly walk malware into the premises and the network via removable media. There need to be strict and well-documented controls that everyone is aware of.

### The Security Triad  (CIA)

## Introduction to Information Assurance

Information security is a set of practices designed to keep personal data secure from unauthorized access and alteration during storing or transmitting from one place to another. Information security is designed and implemented to protect the print, electronic and other private, sensitive and personal data from unauthorized persons. It is used to protect data from being misused, disclosure, destruction, modification or disruption.


**Information Assurance vs. Cybersecurity**

Information security and cybersecurity may be used substitutable but are two different things. Cybersecurity is a practice used to provide security from online attacks, while inormation security is a specific discipline that falls under cybersecurity. Information security is focusing on network and App code.

**Information security principle**

There are some basic components of information security which are discussed below.

Confidentiality is one of the basic elements of information security. Data is confidential when only authorized people access it. To ensure confidentiality one needs to use all the techniques designed for security like strong password, encryption, authentication and defense against penetration attacks.

Integrity refers to maintaining data and preventing it from modifications either accidentally or maliciously. Techniques used for confidentiality may protect data integrity as a cybercriminal can’t change data when they can’t get access to it. To ensure integrity in-depth few tools help in improving it.

Availability is another basic element in information security. It is vital to make sure that your data is not accessed by unauthorized persons but only those who have permission can access it. Availability in information security means matching network and computing resources to compute data access and implement a better policy for disaster recovery purposes.

Authentication

Non-repudiation

Access control

**Information security policy**
* Discuss the three overarching security design principles (i.e., onlyy necessary, simple, ease of use).
* Describe the principle of least privilege as it relates to computer security.
* Describe the principle of secuirty in depth.
* Describe the principlemoffail secure or fail safe and false positive or false negative as it relates to ccomputer security.

Information security policy is a document that an enterprise draws up, based on its specific needs and quirks. It helps to establish what data to protect and in what ways. These policies guide an organization during the decision making about procuring cybersecurity tools. It also mandates employee behavior and responsibilities.

An organization information security policy should include

    It should describe the purpose of the infosec program and objectives
    It must define thekey terms used in the document to ensure shared understanding
    It must contain password policy
    It should determine who has access to what data
    It must include the employee’s roles and responsibilities to safeguard data. [1]

## Regulations & Frameworks
Major us federal cybersecurity laws 

**Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) (1996)**

HIPPA was enacted in 1996 and signed by president bill clinton. Before HIPPA, there was no standard method for safeguarding the Protected Personal Information (PPI) that organizations in the healthcare industry stored. there were no security best practices in place.  one of 
the reasons that there were no standards related to cybersecurity in the healthcare industry was that health records were traditionally stored as paper records. Just before the introduction of HIPPA, the healthcare industry was scrambling to move away from paper records to become more efficient.  the need to become more efficient drove the need to access and transfer patient information quickly.

**Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act GLBA) (1999)**

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley was signed into law in 1999.  this law is also known as the financial services modernization act of 1999.
the main thing that glba did was to repeal a portion of an outdated law from 1933.  This 1933 law was called the glass–steagall act.  the glass–steagall act prevented companies from doing combined business in banking, securities, and insurance.  a bank was also not allowed to sell insurance or securities.

**Homeland Security Act (2002)**

The homeland security act was signed into law by george w. bush in 2002. this act included the federal information security management act (fisma).
The united states introduced the homeland security act following several terrorist attacks in the united states.  these terrorist acts include the world trade center bombing and mailing of anthrax spores to some news outlets and some government officials. [2]

**Vulnerabiliity**

There is a term called vulnerability assessment which is quite similar to penetration testing.

**Types of threat actors**
* Cyber terrorists
* Government-sponsored/state-sponsored actors
* Organized crime/cybercriminals 
* Hacktivists
* Insiders
* Script kiddies
* Internal user errors

**Common Threat Actor Motivations**

Political, Economic, Technical, and Military Agendas: Threat actors such as Hacktivists and Government-Backed Actors share such motivations. They are focused and have a set objective/target in mind when they start planning an attack. Moreover, this data is rarely seen available for sale on the black market.  For example, the absence of data stolen from the Equifax Attack has many wondering whether the attack was orchestrated/sponsored by another country.

Profits/Financial Gain: The profit motivation is one of the most frequent motivations of cybercriminals. These threat actors won't usually care about penetrating a specific organization or  
business.Moreover, they won't care about the discoverability of the crime because they're only interested in stealing assets that they can convert into money as soon as possible.

Notoriety: Some threat actors are motivated by reputation and attention and will actively seek targets that will help them gain recognition. In fact, those agents that seek notoriety will often ignore chances to attack non-visible assets/targets that won't draw any attention.

Revenge: Getting back at someone is a pervasive human trait; it's also a common threat actor motivation. The threat actors who plan an attack for revenge are most likely to be either employees or ex-employees -- giving them intimate knowledge about an organization's systems, networks, and even defenses.

Overlap of Motivations: Of course, a threat actor may be motivated by more than one threat actor motivation. For example, they can have a revenge mindset along with a political agenda.

Understanding threat actors and their motivations is an essential step in the cybersecurity process. It will help you map out your defenses and may help you better outmaneuver attackers successfully. 

Make sure that your organization's threat model accounts for various threat actor motivations. You can do this by assessing what business category you fall into and what kind of threat actors are most likely  
to target you. Use this information as a guide to fixing vulnerabilities, uncovering new ones, and implementing internal security policies. You can get the latest info about emerging attacks here.

Now we should say that some threat actors aren't discovered by anyone for even years at a time, simply because they don't draw attention to themselves. These threats are called Advanced Persistent Threats  
(APTs). 

Threat Intelligence Feeds that grant you access to information about newly-discovered Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are particularly useful when it comes to protecting yourself against such persistent  
threats.

**Reconnaissance/Footprinting**
In general, reconnaissance relies upon a composite set of techniques and processes and has not to be considered limited to information characterizing the target at a technological level, such as, the used  
hardware or the version of software components. Attackers also aim at collecting details related to the physical location of the victim, phone numbers, names of the people working in the targeted  
organizations and their email addresses. In fact, any bit of knowledge may be used to develop a software exploit or to reveal weaknesses in the defensive systems.

Information Gathering and getting to know the target systems is the first process in ethical hacking. Reconnaissance is a set of processes and techniques (Footprinting, Scanning & Enumeration) used to  
covertly discover and collect information about a target system.

**Reconnaissance**
This is the first step of Hacking. It is also called as Footprinting and information gathering Phase. This is the preparatory phase where we collect as much information as possible about the target. We usually collect information about three groups,

Network

Host

People involved

There are two types of Footprinting:
Active: Directly interacting with the target to gather information about the target. Eg Using Nmap tool to scan the target
Passive: Trying to collect the information about the target without directly accessing the target. This involves collecting information from social media, public websites etc.


**Scanning**
Three types of scanning are involved:
Port scanning: This phase involves scanning the target for the information like open ports, Live systems, various services running on the host.
Vulnerability Scanning: Checking the target for weaknesses or vulnerabilities which can be exploited. Usually done with help of automated tools
Network Mapping: Finding the topology of network, routers, firewalls servers if any, and host information and drawing a network diagram with the available information. This map may serve as a valuable piece of information throughout the haking process.

**Gaining Access** 
This phase is where an attacker breaks into the system/network using various tools or methods. After entering into a system, he has to increase his privilege to administrator level so he can install an application he needs or modify data or hide data.

**Maintaining Access**
Hacker may just hack the system to show it was vulnerable or he can be so mischievous that he wants to maintain or persist the connection in the background without the knowledge of the user. This can be done using Trojans, Rootkits or other malicious files. The aim is to maintain the access to the target until he finishes the tasks he planned to accomplish in that target.

**Clearing Tracks** 
No thief wants to get caught. An intelligent hacker always clears all evidence so that in the later point of time, no one will find any traces leading to him. This involves modifying/corrupting/deleting the values of Logs, modifying registry values and uninstalling all applications he used and deleting all folders he created.
