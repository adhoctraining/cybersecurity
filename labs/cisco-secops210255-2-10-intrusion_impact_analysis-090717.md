#### Intrusion Impact Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------
* 2.8 Compare and contrast impact and no impact for these items
	+ 2.8.a False Positive
		- Rule is matched and no attack
	+ 2.8.b False Negative
		- No Ruleis matched and attack is present
	+ 2.8.c True Positive
		- Rule is matched and attack is present
	+ 2.8.d True Negative
		- No rule is matched and no attack
	+ Tuning Rule Match, updating information is key.
* 2.9 Interpret a provided intrusion event and host profile 
  to calculate the impact flag generated by Firepower 
  Management Center (FMC)
	+ Impact Flag of 0:
		- Observed: Generic information, Events not on profiled
		  network
		- Action: None but noted
	+ Impact Flag of 4:
		- Observed: Previously unseen on protected network
		- Action: Gather more information, check for
		  connections
	+ Impact Flag of 3:
		- Observed: Event observed but relevent port or
		  protocol not used
		- Action: Gather more information, verify associated
		  ports are closed
	+ Impact Flag of 2:
		- Observed: Event has no associated vulnerability, port
		  or protocol is in use.
		- Action: Investigate; Find exposed host
	+ Impact Flag of 1:
		- Observed: Indication of Compromise; Host is
		  vulnerable
		- Action: Take all measures; host is compromised or
		  vulnerable.
