### Understand Incident Response Elements
* 3.2 Map elements to these steps of analysis based on the NIST.SP800‐61 r2
	+ 3.2.a Preparation (Determines Structure of IR)
		- Preparing to Handle Incidents
		- Preventing Incidents
		- Incident Response Plan element that match: 
			+ Mission
			+ Organizational Approach to incident Response
			+ How does it fit into organization
			+ Roadmap for maturing the incident response 
			  capability.
	+ 3.2.b Detection and analysis (IR Capabilities)
		- Attack Vectors
		- Signs of an Incident
			+ Some attacks are easy to detect others are 
			  almost impossible to detect.
			+ Volume of potential incidents is high.
			+ May require technical knowledge.
		- Two Categories:
			+ precursors
			+ indicators
		- Incident response plan element that match:
			+ How the incident response team will communicate
			  with the rest of the organization and with other
			  organization.
			+ Roadmap for maturing the incident response 
			  capability.
	+ 3.2.c Containment, eradication, and recovery (IR Capabilties)
		- Strategy and Goals
		- Metrics for measuring the incident response
		  capability and its effectiveness
	+ 3.2.d Post‐incident analysis (lessons learned) (IR Capabilties)
		- Metrics for measuring the incident response
		  capability and its effectiveness
		- Roadmap for maturing the incident response
		  capability.
* 3.3 Map the organization stakeholders against the NIST 
  IR categories (C2M2, NIST.SP800‐61 r2)
	+ 3.3.a Preparation
		- Incident Response Team
		- Managers and Decision Makers
	+ 3.3.b Detection and analysis
		- IRT and Section 3.2.4 and 3.2.7

		- External Incident Response Teams (if applicable)
		- System owner
		- Human Resources (if involves employee)

	+ 3.3.c Containment, eradication, and recovery
		- IRT and Sections 3.3.1, 3.3.4
		- Everyone including contractors
	+ 3.3.d Post‐incident analysis (lessons learned)
		- Section 3.4.1
