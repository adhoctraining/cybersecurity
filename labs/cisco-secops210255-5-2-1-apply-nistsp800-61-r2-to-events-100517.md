* 5.2 Apply the NIST.SP800‐61 r2 incident handling process 
  to an event
	+ Preparation:
		1. Would the organization consider this activity to be
		   an incident? If so, which of the organization’s
		   policies does this activity violate? (Section 2.1)
		2. What measures are in place to attempt to prevent this
		   type of incident from occurring or to limits impact?
		   (Section 3.1.2)
	+ Detection and Analysis:
		1. What precursors of the incident, if any, might the
		   organization detect? Would any precursors cause the
		   organization to take action before the incident
		   occurred? (Sections 3.2.2, 3.2.3)
		2. What indicators of the incident might the
		   organization detect? Which indicators would cause
		   someone to think that an incident might have
		   occurred? (Sections 3.2.2, 3.2.3)
		3. What additional tools might be needed to detect this
		   particular incident? (Section 3.2.3)
		4. How would the incident response team analyze and
		   validate this incident? What personnel would be
		   involved in the analysis and validation process?
		   (Section 3.2.4)
		5. To which people and groups within the organization
		   would the team report the incident? (Section 3.2.7)
		6. How would the team prioritize the handling of this
		   incident? (Section 3.2.6)
	+ Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:
		1. What strategy should the organization take to contain
		   the incident? Why is this strategy preferable to
		   others? (Section 3.3.1)
		2. What could happen if the incident were not contained?
		   (Section 3.3.1)
		3. What additional tools might be needed to respond to
		   this particular incident? (Sections 3.3.1, 3.3.4)
		4. Which personnel would be involved in the containment,
		   eradication, and/or recovery processes? (Sections
		   3.3.1, 3.3.4)
		5. What sources of evidence, if any, should the
		   organization acquire? How would the evidence be
		   acquired? Where would it be stored? How long should
		   it be retained? (Sections 3.2.5, 3.3.2, 3.4.3)
	+ Post-Incident Activity:
		1. Who would attend the lessons learned meeting
		   regarding this incident? (Section 3.4.1)
		2. What could be done to prevent similar incidents from
		   occurring in the future? (Section 3.1.2)
		3. What could be done to improve detection of similar
		   incidents? (Section 3.1.2)
	+ General Questions:
		1. How many incident response team members would
		   participate in handling this incident? (Section 
		   2.4.3)
		2. Besides the incident response team, what groups
		   within the organization would be involved in
		   handling this incident? (Section 2.4.4)
		3. To which external parties would the team report the
		   incident? When would each report occur? How would
		   each report be made? What information would you
		   report or not report, and why? (Section 2.3.2)
		4. What other communications with external parties may
		   occur? (Section 2.3.2)
		5. What tools and resources would the team use in
		   handling this incident? (Section 3.1.1)
		6. What aspects of the handling would have been
		   different if the incident had occurred at a different
		   day and time (on-hours versus off-hours)? (Section
		   2.4.2)
		7. What aspects of the handling would have been
	        different if the incident had occurred at a different
		   physical location (onsite versus offsite)? (Section
		   2.4.2)
* 5.3 Define these activities as they relate to incident 
  handling
	+ 5.3.a Identification
	+ 5.3.b Scoping
	+ 5.3.c Containment
	+ 5.3.d Remediation
	+ 5.3.e Lesson‐based hardening
	+ 5.3.f Reporting
