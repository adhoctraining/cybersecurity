###Compare and Contrast Analysis Methods

* 4.10 Compare and contrast deterministic and probabilistic
  analysis
	+ To Determine outcomes or possible outcomes
	+ Deterministic Method
		- All data used for analysis is known
		- All based on facts of incidents outcome can be 
		  determined
		- Analysis should be right on target
		- Cause and Effect (If A then B)
	+ Probabilistic Method
		- All data is not previously known but assumed.
		- Details and actions change analysis and provide more
		  of a range of possibilities
		- Outcome is probable but not definitive.
		- Scenario Driven (What Ifs... If A  then B or C, or B
		  only or C only, or both A and B)
* 4.5 Describe the retrospective analysis method to find a
  malicious file, provided file analysis report.
	+ The outcome is already known, the cause or causes to be
  	  determined
