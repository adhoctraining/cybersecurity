the reasons that there were no standards related to cybersecurity in the healthcare industry was that health records were traditionally stored as paper records. Just before the introduction of HIPPA, the healthcare industry was scrambling to move away from paper records to become more efficient.  the need to become more efficient drove the need to access and transfer patient information quickly.
