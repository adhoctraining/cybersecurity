[DAY ONE: BUILDING CONTAINERS WITH cSRX, 2 ND EDITION](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/day-one-books/day-one-building-containers-with-docker-csrx.pdf)
This Day One book introduces platform and container concepts and the advantages of
using the cSRX to secure them. The authors present the Docker platform, explain how it is
different from virtual machine platforms, review its security, and then show how to spin up
containers on the Docker platform on different operating systems. The book then provides
multiple step-by-step lab guides that show readers how to implement Juniper’s cSRX on a
server with Ubuntu OS, and how it can protect other containers on the same server. But the
book doesn’t stop there, it continues by showing how to deploy the cSRX in Kubernetes, how
to integrate the cSRX with Juniper’s networking management system, Contrail, and how the
cSRX can be deployed as a containerized function block to provide advanced security poli-
cies, NAT, UTM, and IPS for a Kubernetes network
