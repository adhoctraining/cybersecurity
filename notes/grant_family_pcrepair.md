<p>
Things to look at regarding a slow computer:

- search %appdata% and review for indicators of compromise (checked, not much there)
- Run Microsoft Defender (everything appears to be okay)
- System file repair (no evidence of a problem)
- create a restore point (pcmech_08.03.22 Created)
- search %temp% to find temp files and delete (small percentage of temp files)
- run prefetch - (deleted them all)

reboot
