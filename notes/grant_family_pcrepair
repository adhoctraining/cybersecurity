Things to look at regarding a slow computer:
- Remove unsused software and bloatware
- Look at startup programs. Use the task manager. Turn off re-boot and re-start one at a time
- Check out flle fragmentation.
- System Cleaning and hygeine:
  - WinDirStat
  - A file that you may want to remove is hybefile.sys. Don't just re,ove it. It is the hibernation file. You can turn off hibernation with the powercfg.exe  hibernate /off 
  - Scan for malicious software.
  - search %appdata% and review for indicators of compromise
  - Run Microsoft Defender
- System file repair
  - run chkdsk to scan for errors
  - run sfc /scannow (system file scanner)
