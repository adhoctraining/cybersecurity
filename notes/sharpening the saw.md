> Key Areas to Focus On:

    IKEscan (VPN Presence)
    Identify XSS in code
    Remediation priority
    Metasploit output
    Coding language
    Identify command execution
    Understand coding flow
    How to setup a reverse shell in Bash, Powershell, Perl, and Python
    How to upgrade a Shell in Python
    SOCKS Proxy
    nmap, nmap, nmap
    
As others have said in this subreddit, you should be skilled in Nmap, netcat, shells, web application security vulnerabilities and their remediations, you should know how to read and write code in Python and Bash. Ruby and Powershell are also nice to know but most of the scripting questions that I got were mainly focused on Python and bash. You should also get familiar with most of the tools available in Kali linux.

Sign up for TryHackMe and do their Pentest+ path. Get your hands dirty with this stuff. I'd say focus on the nmap and OWASP Top 10 rooms if you're working on limited time, otherwise the whole path is worth it and pretty dang fun

### Exam AZ-800: Administering Windows Server Hybrid Core Infrastructure (Operating System)
I took the plunge and completed the AZ-800: Administering Windows Server Hybrid Core Infrastructure (beta) exam this morning (day after release). It was not as hard as I expected overall however there were some sections I could really have studied more on. My pool of questions really seemed to focus on the following:

* Deploying and managing domain controllers on-premise and Azure
* Configuring and managing forest and domain trusts on-premise
* Managing users and groups in multi-domain and multi-forest scenarios 
* Implementing group managed service accounts
* Managing Azure AD Connect and Authentication in on-premise and hybrid environments
* A little bit about Group Policy
* A lot about Azure Arc!
* Some Hyper-V and NIC management
* Creating and managing Windows Server container images
* Configuring connections to VM
* Integrating Windows Server DNS with Azure Private DNS zones
* On-premise DHCP
* Azure AD Application Proxy
* Implementing and configuring Distributed file system
* Configuring disk, volumes and data de-duplication
* Azure File and Azure File Sync Service
