 <h2>What is cybersecurity?</h2>
<br>
	Securing the flow the flow of information through networks and networks, cybersecurity, has grown since its conception, and each year, 
	organizations experience more significant cybersecurity threats. To combat the threats, procedures 
	are created to express the goals and expectations of the organization. The security policy 
	procedures define a framework defining controls such as those delineated in the NIST Cybersecurity 
	Framework or similar documents. Framework documentation provides guidelines to aid in developing 
	policy for the organization's cybersecurity program. (Almeida, Carvalho, & Cruz, 2018; Helil & 
	Rahman, 2017). Additionally, organizations implement cybersecurity standards such as ISO20001 
	to implement audits and procedures that demonstrate commitment to adherence to an internationally 
	accepted standard. Clear and specific guidance in handling threats and incidence is an excellent 
	way to protect assets and resources (Yazdanmehr & Wang, 2016). 
<p>
	Advances in technology that created advances in ICT also made advanced hacking techniques. (Tarlow, 2019). 
	Data breaches lead to severe leaks and threaten corporations and government agencies (Cheng, Long, 
	Fang Liu, and Yao, 2017). The loss of sensitive information can lead to significant reputational 
	damage and financial losses and even can be detrimental to the long-term stability of an organization. 
	The rise in data breaches results in severe monetary and legal problems for corporations (Borle, 2015). 
	The increase in extensive profile data breaches and privacy issues has resulted in an intense discussion. 
	Groups expressing their opinions include privacy advocates, security industry professionals, managers, 
	and politicians (Karyda  & Mitrou, 2016). In a California breach report, malware and hacking accounted 
	for 54% of breaches and resulted in over 44,6 million records (Harris & General, 2016). California 
	data breach report.
	<h2>Technology and malicious code</h2>
<p>
ILOVEYOU, sometimes referred to as Love Bug or Love Letter for you, is a computer worm that infected over ten million Windows personal computers on and after 5 May 2000. It started spreading as an email message with the subject line "ILOVEYOU" and the attachment "LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs."[1] At the time, Windows computers often hid the latter file extension ("VBS," a type of interpreted file) by default because it is an extension for a file type that Windows knows, leading unwitting users to think it was a normal text file. Opening the attachment activates the Visual Basic script. First, the worm inflicts damage on the local machine, overwriting random files (including Office files and image files; however, it hides MP3 files instead of deleting them), then, it copies itself to all addresses in the Windows Address Book used by Microsoft Outlook, allowing it to spread much faster than any other previous email worm.[2][3] 
<p>
Blaster (also known as Lovsan, Lovesan, or MSBlast) was a computer worm that spread on computers running operating systems Windows XP and Windows 2000 during August 2003.[1] The worm was first noticed and started spreading on August 11, 2003. The rate that it spread increased until the number of infections peaked on August 13, 2003. Once a network (such as a company or university) was infected, it spread more quickly within the network because firewalls typically did not prevent internal machines from using a certain port.[2] Filtering by ISPs and widespread publicity about the worm curbed the spread of Blaster. 
<p>
Stuxnet is a malicious computer worm first uncovered in 2010 and thought to have been in development since at least 2005. Stuxnet targets supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and is believed to be responsible for causing substantial damage to the nuclear program of Iran.[2] Although neither country has openly admitted responsibility, the worm is widely understood to be a cyberweapon built jointly by the United States and Israel in a collaborative effort known as Operation Olympic Games.[3][4][5]
<p>
Stuxnet specifically targets programmable logic controllers (PLCs), which allow the automation of electromechanical processes such as those used to control machinery and industrial processes including gas centrifuges for separating nuclear material. Exploiting four zero-day flaws,[6] Stuxnet functions by targeting machines using the Microsoft Windows operating system and networks, then seeking out Siemens Step7 software. Stuxnet reportedly compromised Iranian PLCs, collecting information on industrial systems and causing the fast-spinning centrifuges to tear themselves apart.[7] Stuxnet's design and architecture are not domain-specific and it could be tailored as a platform for attacking modern SCADA and PLC systems (e.g., in factory assembly lines or power plants), most of which are in Europe, Japan, and the United States.[8] Stuxnet reportedly ruined almost one-fifth of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.[9] Targeting industrial control systems, the worm infected over 200,000 computers and caused 1,000 machines to physically degrade.[10] 
<p>
The CryptoLocker ransomware attack was a cyberattack using the CryptoLocker ransomware that occurred from 5 September 2013 to late May 2014. The attack utilized a trojan that targeted computers running Microsoft Windows,[1] and was believed to have first been posted to the Internet on 5 September 2013.[2] It propagated via infected email attachments, and via an existing Gameover ZeuS botnet.[3] When activated, the malware encrypted certain types of files stored on local and mounted network drives using RSA public-key cryptography, with the private key stored only on the malware's control servers. The malware then displayed a message which offered to decrypt the data if a payment (through either bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher) was made by a stated deadline, and it threatened to delete the private key if the deadline passes. If the deadline was not met, the malware offered to decrypt data via an online service provided by the malware's operators, for a significantly higher price in bitcoin. There was no guarantee that payment would release the encrypted content.
<p>
Although CryptoLocker itself was easily removed, the affected files remained encrypted in a way which researchers considered unfeasible to break. Many said that the ransom should not be paid, but did not offer any way to recover files; others said that paying the ransom was the only way to recover files that had not been backed up. Some victims claimed that paying the ransom did not always lead to the files being decrypted. 
<p>
The WannaCry ransomware attack was a worldwide cyberattack in May 2017 by the WannaCry ransomware cryptoworm, which targeted computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system by encrypting data and demanding ransom payments in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.[5] It propagated through EternalBlue, an exploit developed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) for older Windows systems. EternalBlue was stolen and leaked by a group called The Shadow Brokers a month prior to the attack. While Microsoft had released patches previously to close the exploit, much of WannaCry's spread was from organizations that had not applied these, or were using older Windows systems that were past their end-of-life. These patches were imperative to organizations' cyber security but many were not implemented due to ignorance of their importance. Some have claimed a need for 24/7 operation, aversion to risking having formerly working applications breaking because of patch changes, lack of personnel or time to install them, or other reasons.
<p>
The attack began at 07:44 UTC on 12 May 2017 and was halted a few hours later at 15:03 UTC by the registration of a kill switch discovered by Marcus Hutchins. The kill switch prevented already infected computers from being encrypted or further spreading WannaCry.[6] The attack was estimated to have affected more than 200,000 computers across 150 countries, with total damages ranging from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. Security experts believed from preliminary evaluation of the worm that the attack originated from North Korea or agencies working for the country. 

<h2>A national response</h2>
During the late 1990s, security professionals were using information assurance tools in concert with vulnerability scanners to detect and remove vulnerabilities from the systems for which they are responsible.

There’s just one problem – each security vendor has its own database with little to no crossover. Each vendor’s tool generates its own alert for detected vulnerabilities, and these alerts must be manually cross-referenced between the tools to determine if they are separate issues or multiple alerts for the same issue.

he very first CVE List contained 321 vulnerabilities, chosen after careful deliberation and consideration of duplicates. In September 1999, the first CVE List was made public. MITRE announced the creation of the CVE List during a press conference. It also placed a booth at SANS 1999 to help introduce the List and promote its adoption.

A well-known counterpart to CVE List, the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), was formed in 2005. NVD expands on the CVE List and, like CVE, is sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, though they are separate projects. Unlike the CVE List, which intentionally excludes scores for vulnerabilities so as to remain apart from environmental factors, NVD provides vulnerability scoring, which it bases on risk and impact. When provided by vendors, NVD attaches information on fix versions, patches and updates that resolve the vulnerability. Both CVE List and NVD will add reference links to the originating vendor advisories and any other vendor advisories that apply to the specific CVE.
